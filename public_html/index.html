                            <!--                            <p>So it all started in the spring of 1996.  New kid moving to Las Cruces NM, Omar Rios, attending a new school and meeting new people. It was a new start for a new kid and learning his way around a new time didn't come easy.  A new school meant new friends and before he knew it, Omar met a kid, Mike Martinez, that shared similar interests.  They clicked!! As the school semester went by they hung out non stop.  Omar soon found himself a job as a "sandwich artist" and almost every night Mike would get dropped off at the restaurant and just hang out.  Although Mike didn't work at the restaurant he enjoyed the time spent there whether it was doing homework or helping Omar with daily duties.-->
                            <!--                                As they grew so did their friendship. Omar soon found himself working at another restaurant after a year or so. He was now flipping burgers and convinced Mike to come work with him.  They both worked a lot and had a blast while doing a great job. They continued working together and worked their way up into shift lead roles and in about a year or so found a new job at a cool new place that was going to be the HOTTEST place in town.-->
                            <!--                                Their friendship grew and grew over the years as well as their positions at work.  They both did a great job and were noticed by the higher-ups in the company and as they got older they were both creating opportunities for themselves.  In mid 2003 Omar was offered a position as service manager in AZ while Mike was following his career in NM. While Omar was making a name for himself in AZ, Mike was doing the same in NM.-->
                            <!--                                While working in different states both Omar and Mike kept in touch. Omar tried to convince Mike to move to AZ.  Mike wasn't really up to it.  He was doing a great job in NM and was opening doors for himself.-->
                            <!--                                After about five years some changes had happened in both Omar and Mike's lives and they had an opportunity to work together again, and once again, the new place in town and the state.  Omar moved back to NM and both he and Mike were the first two managers that were hired for the new concept and opened up the flagship store, the first of many in NM.  As the company grew so did their careers.  They both bounced around from Kitchen Manager, Bar Manager, Service Manager to ultimately General Manager. They both assisted in opening stores both in ABQ and Las Cruces and assisted in stores in other cities.  They had a blast opening up stores and meeting new people.-->
                            <!--                                After about ten years of working together in the same company both Omar and Mike decided to start with new companies and continue their journey into management. Both Omar and Mike began new careers in new and maybe not so new areas.  Mike moved back to Las Cruces to be close to family and Omar was very busy in his jobs as a manager and a dad.  Both guys have worked very hard over the years and gained a bunch of experience in the functions of the restaurant/food & beverage industry.-->
                            <!--                                After 25 years of friendship and almost the same in working together they both started talking about their life outside of the industry, or at least working for a company or someone else.  Throughout the years they had both expressed interest in doing something more than being managers in a company.  They discussed other interests and other things that they felt might be a joy for them to do.  Both had expressed interest in owning a food truck.  For the most part it was always just talk.  Nothing more than a dream..-->
                            <!--                                Mike and Omar continued to work as managers but as the days, months went by they couldn't stop thinking about the food truck idea.  They started to talk more and more about it and before you know it they were excitedly talking about menu ideas, locations, truck styles and many other things.  Next thing you know Omar came to Mike with an idea to finally get the ball rolling.  In mid April both Mike and Omar put an order in to get a custom trailer made and began their dream to start their business.  After 4 months of waiting their trailer is almost complete and they're almost ready to hit the streets of NM.</p>-->
