            <li>Exciting flavor combination seekers</li>

    <h2>Persona</h2>

    <p><b>Name:</b> Ritchie with a 'T'</p>

    <p><b>Age:</b> 41</p>

    <p><b>Profession:</b> Founder and owner of Strings N' Things, a small guitar shop. Also owns three different rental properties. Local entrepreneur who supports small business and values integrity.</p>

    <p><b>Technology:</b> Mac with IOS power user. Uses an Apple iPhone XS with unlimited 5g data connection everywhere he goes. In the office, he uses a 27" iMacÂ® with Intel Core i5 and at home he uses an iPad Pro.</p>

    <p><b>Attitudes and Behaviors:</b> Ritchie uses social media daily, and posts a lot of reviews to help inform the community about his experiences at different restaurants and food trucks in the area. Ritchie posts photos of food on different social media platforms</p>

    <p><b>Frustrations and Needs:</b> Ritchie needs to look up a food truck's information so he can locate the truck and find descriptions of the food that truck offers. He is looking for a menu that grabs his attention with descriptive adjectives and appealing photos, but is having a hard time finding actual websites and not just listings in an app.</p>

    <p><b>Goals:</b> When visiting a website, Ritchie is only concerned with two things: Is this food truck worth seeking out? and does this website offer enough insight into the truck's whereabouts to find it? Can Ritchie, by looking at the food truck's online presence, determine whether he would visit that food truck or not? </p>

    <p><b>User Story:</b> As a local entrepreneur and "foodie", I want to see online menus, photos and prices of food, along with the food truck's location.</p>
