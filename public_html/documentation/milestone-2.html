    <h1>2 Guys, 1 Grill Milestone 2</h1>
    <h3>Content Strategy</h3>
    <p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following sections:</p>

    <p><b>Landing/Home Page:</b> This page will feature a carousel with three different ads (one to highlight a menu item, one to inform users they can find the location of the truck and one to inform users they can hire the truck for their personal events). Each ad will have a button to redirect the user to the corresponding section of the webpage. The buttons will be labeled: Menu, Find Us and Hire Us. The logo will act as the 'home' button to get back to the landing page. There will be a nav bar with a toggler so it shrinks down to a hamburger menu in the mobile version.</p>

    <p><b>Menu:</b> This page will highlight a feature menu item with a hand-drawn graphic. All menus will utilize a legible, straightforward, but playful font and the tone of voice for the menu will be casual with explosive descriptive words scattered throughout.</p>

    <p><b>Find Us:</b> This page will contain links to all social media platforms. I want this page to use JavaScript marquee to animate a png graphic of a food truck "driving" across the screen.</p>

    <p><b>Hire Us:</b> This page simplifies the process of booking the food truck for an upcoming event. It will lay down some ground rules for food truck requests. This page will utilize a contact form that will be named 2 Guys, 1 Grill Request Form. This form will ask for important information regarding hiring the truck such as; type of event, expected # of guests, date and time.</p>

    <p><b>The Truck:</b> This page will have a responsive image gallery to follow the life of the truck from as early as documented by the owner. I would like to have the images animated in some way with the hover. The truck does not yet have a wrap for the outside, so this page will create some hype about keeping up with the look of the truck.</p>

    <p><b>About Us:</b> This page features a timeline to illustrate where the guys came from. Documenting the year in each photo is going to be very important here because these guys have been friends for about 20 years now.</p>

    <p><b>Contact Us:</b> The Contact Us page has a very simple form for the user to fill out to send the owners a message. This page will display the company's logo, contact phone number, e-mail address and a picture of the co-owners.</p>
